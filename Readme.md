# How to dynamically switch the grid's data source and recreate columns at runtime


<p>This example demonstrates how to allow a user to use the same grid to view different data sources. Grid columns are recreated when a new data source is assigned. Please notice that the data source is unconditionally assigned on each post back / callback within the ASPxGridView.Load event handler, while columns are recreated only after switching the data source.</p><p>See also:<br />
